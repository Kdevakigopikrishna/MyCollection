recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Use the microphone as a source for input
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening for your search query...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)

try:
    # Recognize the voice input
    command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    print(f"You said: {command}")

    search_results = search(command, num_results=5)
    
    # Print the top 5 search results
    print("Here are the top results:")
    for index, result in enumerate(search_results, start=1):
        print(f"Result {index}: {result}")
